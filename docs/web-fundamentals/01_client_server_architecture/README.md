## Docs.dev - Client-Server Architecture

Lets start with a core concept of **Web Fundamentals**.

### Client-Server Architecture

Client Server architecture is a model where _multiple client (users) request_ and _receive services_ from a centralized server.

### Basic components

-   Client

    -   The frontend or the user interface.
    -   Sends requests to the server (like submitting a form or fetching data).

-   Server
    -   The backend or the brain behind the app.
    -   Handles requests, processes data, interacts with the database, and sends responses.

### Communication

-   Typically uses **HTTP/HTTPS** for communication.
-   _Clients send requests_ â†’ _Server processes_ â†’ _Sends back responses_.
-   In modern apps, this often happens via **REST APIs** or **GraphQL**.
