## Docs.dev - Before Coding!

### Where to start?

**In the world of coding**!<br />
Where to start?, is the biggest question nowadays.

Many will suggest you, You can start coding in `notepad`.<br />
Which may be a good idea but not the best.

Because, notepad is capable enough to make a source file.<br />
Open notepad then create a file and save it with extension `.js`
```txt
// index.js
console.log("Hello World!")
```

> [!important]\
> **source file**, is the file which has an specific extension type.\
> And when we exexute the file using a compiler, it produces some output.

*As I said*!<br />
`notepad` is capable enough to create a source file, but it is not a best choice,<br />
If you are targetting to code for longer.

You must go with an **IDE**! ‚≠ê

### What is an `IDE`?

IDE, stands for **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment.<br />
Which provides all *the facilities you will use to build any project*.

    ```
